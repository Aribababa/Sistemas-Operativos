<b>Synopsis</b>

This project is about a char driver to control an external LED for a Rapberry Pi.

<b>Code Example</b>


<i> Led.h</i></br>
This .h file is the library for controling the LED and create PWM signals.</br>
<i>GPIO_driver.c</i></br>
This file is the char driver that initialize</br>
<i> test.c</i></br>
Contains a basic test for teh driver we made.</br>

<b>Motivation</b>

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

<b>Installation</b>

In order to run the drive, you need to clone all the files into your computer, then create the module using the commands shown on the Makefie and finally run the test code.

<b>Tests</b>

The test we made is in the repository with the name of test.c</br>
That code puts a period for th ePWM signal and runs the PWM function</br>
